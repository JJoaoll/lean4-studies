* Functional Programming in Lean
** Getting to know
*** TODO Text resume
Lean4 does have a repl integrated with the LSP enviroment.

**** POO
This text talks so much about POO that hurt's me. I can't get so much POO anymore.

*** Evaluating
U should use the `#eval` to evaluate, such as this example show us:
#+begin_src lean4
#eval 1 + 2
#+end_src

Also the function application works just like in Haskell.
(🔍) ~ So, i've just figured out that lean4 is a strict language, not a strict one. What a shame!
*** Types
When necessary, u can use type coercions with ":"
#+begin_src lean4
#eval (1 + 2 : Nat)
-- So look this:
#eval  1 - 2        -->  0 : Nat
#eval (1 - 2 : Int) --> -1 : Int
#+end_src

As u can check the values with  `#eval`
u also can check the types with `#check`
#+begin_src lean4
#check (1 - 2 : Int)  --> 1 - 2 : Int (without performing the operation.)
#+end_src

*** Functions and Definitions
to definitions, use `def`, like:
#+begin_src lean4
def hello := "Hello"
#+end_src

Note how great the `:=` fits for assignments instead of `=`.
If u wanna pick the type too, u can do it like this:
#+begin_src lean4
def lean : String := "Lean"
#+end_src

When it comes to define a function, there are a variaty of ways to do that.
The simpliest one (they say it):
#+begin_src lean4
def succ (n : Nat) : Nat := n + 1
-- or:
def pred (n : Nat) : Nat :=
  n - 1
#+end_src


Look this another one with more arguments:
#+begin_src lean4
def maximum (n : Nat) (k : Nat) : Nat :=
  if n < k then
    k
  else n
#+end_src

Lean4 does use currying as default.
(my exercises are in somewhere but it's not my intent to share them :P)

**** Defining Types:
U use the same `def` keyword just like with the values (including functions)
#+begin_src lean4
def Str  : Type := String
def aStr : Str  := "Look at me, i'm a real String!"
#+end_src

some explanation about "aStr" definition:
"The reason this works is that types follow the same rules as the rest of Lean. Types are expressions,
and in an expression, a defined name can be replaced with its definition. Because Str has been defined
to mean String, the definition of aStr makes sense."

Something very very weird about Lean4 is that, because they want to overload number literals,
this code generates an error:
#+begin_src lean4
def NaturalNumber : Type := Nat
def thirtyEight : NaturalNumber := 38
 -- failed to synthesize instance
-- OfNat NaturalNumber 38
#+end_src

But it works this way:
#+begin_src lean4
def thirtyEight : NaturalNumber := (38 : Nat)
#+end_src

why?
"One way to work around this limitation is by providing the type Nat on the right-hand side of the definition, causing Nat's overloading rules to be used for 38:

The definition is still type-correct because NaturalNumber is the same type as Nat—by definition!"

But don't worry about it, we can see the light here:
"Another solution is to define an overloading for NaturalNumber that works equivalently to the one for Nat. This requires more advanced features of Lean, however."

Finally we have some "abbrev" like here:
#+begin_src lean4
abbrev N : Type := Nat
def thirtyNine : N := 39
-- works well
#+end_src

**** Question:
whats a "foldable | unfoldable | folded | unfolded" definitions?

*** Structures
So they're basically product types..
#+begin_src lean4
structure Point where
  x : Float
  y : Float
deriving Repr

def origin : Point := { x := 0.0, y := 0.0 }
#+end_src

Note that the deriving works as the `Show` in haskell.
When u call the "#eval", it call's the "repr". Look's like
we're gonna discover TypeClasses again..

About extracting things out of products we have:
#+begin_src lean4
#eval origin.x
#eval origin.y

def addPoints (p1 : Point) (p2 : Point) : Point :=
    { x := p1.x + p2.x, y := p1.y + p2.y }

structure Point3D where
    x : Float
    y : Float
    z : Float
deriving Repr

def origin3D : Point3D :=
    { x := 0.0, y := 0.0, z := 0.0 }
#+end_src

"To make programs more concise, Lean also allows the structure type annotation inside the curly braces."
#+begin_src lean4
    #check { x := 0.0, y := 0.0 : Point}
#+end_src

Another convenient syntax is:
#+begin_src lean4
-- default
def zeroX (p : Point) : Point :=
    { x := 0, y := p.y }
-- with syntax
def zeroX (p : Point) : Point :=
    { p with x := 0 }
#+end_src

With this syntax, some issues about refactoring code, e.g., adding new
new columns to a struct would not implie that u're refactoring every
single function that does things like above.

**** Structure constructor
So.. In Lean4, ure forced to use the "mk" thing that
u could avoid in Haskell after get some maturity..
#+begin_src lean4
#check Point.mk 1.5 2.8
 --> { x := 1.5, y := 2.8 } : Point
#+end_src
It's just exacly how a constructor should be in a product type,
but forcing u to use de `(_.mk)` syntax, and what's ok.

- Fine, i was wrong. And the default.. Nice one, lean, nice one.
look at that:
#+begin_src lean4
structure Point where
  point ::
  x : Float
  y : Float
deriving Repr
#+end_src

Some notes about 'behind-the-scenes':
"In fact, just as the curly-braced structure construction syntax is converted to a call to the structure's constructor behind the scenes, the syntax p1.x in the prior definition of addPoints is converted into a call to the Point.x accessor. That is, #eval origin.x and #eval Point.x origin both yield"

LOOK AT THIS!!:
    Accessor dot notation is usable with more than just structure fields. It can also be used for functions that take any number of arguments. More generally, accessor notation has the form TARGET.f ARG1 ARG2 .... If TARGET has type T, the function named T.f is called. TARGET becomes its leftmost argument of type T, which is often but not always the first one, and ARG1 ARG2 ... are provided in order as the remaining arguments. For instance, String.append can be invoked from a string with accessor notation, even though String is not a structure with an append field.

#+begin_src lean4
#eval "one string".append " and another"
#+end_src

(question?) - how the parenthesis works with `#eval` and `#check`?

*** Datatypes, Patterns and Recursion
It's module starts presenting what's a sum and a product of types in a
very simple and didactic way.

Also, the concept "inductive data types" were explained in this short-text:
"Datatypes that allow choices are called sum types and datatypes that can include instances of themselves are called recursive datatypes. Recursive sum types are called inductive datatypes, because mathematical induction may be used to prove statements about them. When programming, inductive datatypes are consumed through pattern matching and recursive functions."

But also look this definition:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Bool where
  | false : Bool
  | true  : Bool
#+end_src

About classical ones, we have:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Nat where
  | zero : Nat
  | succ (n : Nat) : Nat
#+end_src

**** Pattern Matching
Examples:
#+begin_src lean4
def isZero (n : Nat) : Bool :=
    match n with
    | Nat.zero   => true
    | Nat.succ k => false

def pred (n : Nat) : Nat :=
    match n with
    | Nat.zero   => Nat.zero
    | Nat.succ k => k
#+end_src

U can match with products just like sums (...)
#+begin_src lean4
def depth (p : Point3D) : Float :=
    match p with
    | { x:= h, y := w, z := d } => d

-- Better:
def depth (p : Point3D) : Float :=
    match p with
    | Point3D.mk _ _ d => d
#+end_src

**** Recursive Functions
Examples:
#+begin_src lean4
def even (n : Nat) : Bool :=
    match n with
    | Nat.zero   => true
    | Nat.succ k => not (even k)
#+end_src

"Lean ensures by default that every recursive function will eventually reach a base case"
#+begin_src lean4
-- error:
def evenLoops (n : Nat) : Bool :=
    match n with
    | Nat.zero   => true
    | Nat.succ k => not (evenLoops n)
#+end_src

Mensagem do erro:
"fail to show termination for
  evenLoops
with errors
structural recursion cannot be used

well-founded recursion cannot be used, 'evenLoops' does not take any (non-fixed) arguments
"

Another classical's:
#+begin_src lean4
def plus (n : Nat) (k : Nat) : Nat :=
    match k with
    | Nat.zero    => n
    | Nat.succ k' => Nat.succ (plus n k')

def times (n : Nat) (k : Nat) : Nat :=
    match k with
    | Nat.zero    => Nat.zero
    | Nat.succ k' => plus n (times n k')

def monus* (n : Nat) (k : Nat) : Nat :=
    match k with
    | Nat.zero    => n
    | Nat.succ k' => pred (minus n k')
#+end_src

Algumas coisas sobre a terminação da quot foram tratadas,
mas só serão `terminadas` no último capítulo, portanto, nada
a mencionar por aqui.

*** Polymorphism
Look this amazing generalized point:
#+begin_src lean4
structure PPoint (α : Type) where
  x : α
  y : α
deriving Repr
#+end_src

Usage example:
#+begin_src lean4
def natOrigin : PPoint Nat :=
  { x := Nat.zero, y := Nat.zero }

-- My own version
def natOrigin : PPoint Nat :=
  PPoint.mk Nat.zero Nat.zero
#+end_src

Receiving a Type as argument:
#+begin_src lean4
def replaceX (α : Type) (point : PPoint α) (newX : α) : PPoint α :=
    { point with x := newX }
#+end_src

Look how cool is match inside the types <3:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Sign where
  | pos
  | neg

def posOrNegThree (s : Sign) : match s with | Sign.pos => Nat | Sign.neg => Int :=
  match s with
    | Sign.pos => (3 : Nat)
    | Sign.neg => (-3 : Int)
#+end_src

[question?] --> How do i should even deal with this type of return? Because
It's not even "Either".

**** Linked Lists
" Lists are written in square brackets. For instance, a list that contains the prime numbers less than 10 can be written:"
#+begin_src lean4
def primesUnder10 : List Nat := [2, 3, 5, 7]
#+end_src

Behind the scenes, List is an inductive datatype, defined like this:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive List (α : Type) where
  | nil  : List α
  | cons : α → List α → List α
#+end_src

Ok, this looks ugly:
#+begin_src lean4
def explicitPrimesUnder10 : List Nat :=
  List.cons 2 (List.cons 3 (List.cons 5 (List.cons 7 List.nil)))
#+end_src

Soo.. look at this lenght:
#+begin_src lean4
def length (α : Type) (xs' : List α) : Nat :=
  match xs' with
  | List.nil       => Nat.zero
  | List.cons x xs => Nat.succ (length α ys)
#+end_src

"To make it easier to read functions on lists, the bracket notation [] can be used to pattern-match against nil, and an infix :: can be used in place of cons:"
#+begin_src lean4
def length (α : Type) (xs : List α) : Nat :=
  match xs with
  | [] => 0
  | y :: ys => Nat.succ (length α ys)
#+end_src

**** Implicit Arguments
Using "{}" instead of "()" should make the argument implicit somehow.
Look at this:
#+begin_src lean4
def length {α : Type} (xs : List α) : Nat :=
  match xs with
  | [] => 0
  | y :: ys => Nat.succ (length ys)
#+end_src

And now we can do
#+begin_src lean4
#eval length [1, 2, 3]
#+end_src

,instead of
#+begin_src lean4
#eval length Nat [1, 2, 3]
#+end_src

We can also do this way, btw
(by using the std lib):
#+begin_src lean4
#eval [1, 2, 3].length
#+end_src

**** More Built-In Datatypes
"In addition to lists, Lean's standard library contains a number of other structures and inductive datatypes that can be used in a variety of contexts."

***** Option
It's basically the "Maybe" type from Haskell.
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Option (α : Type) : Type where
  | none           : Option α
  | some (val : α) : Option α
#+end_src

This text talk about having layers of optionality:
"The Option type is very similar to nullable types in languages like C# and Kotlin, but it is not identical. In these languages, if a type (say, Boolean) always refers to actual values of the type (true and false), the type Boolean? or Nullable<Boolean> additionally admits the null value. Tracking this in the type system is very useful: the type checker and other tooling can help programmers remember to check for null, and APIs that explicitly describe nullability through type signatures are more informative than ones that don't. However, these nullable types differ from Lean's Option in one very important way, which is that they don't allow multiple layers of optionality. Option (Option Int) can be constructed with none, some none, or some (some 360). C#, on the other hand, forbids multiple layers of nullability by only allowing ? to be added to non-nullable types, while Kotlin treats T?? as being equivalent to T?. This subtle difference is rarely relevant in practice, but it can matter from time to time."

U can use '?' in a function name, look at this:
#+begin_src lean4
def List.head? {α : Type} (xs : List α) : Option α :=
  match xs with
    | []     => none
    | y :: _ => some y
#+end_src

"Using underscores instead of names is a way to clearly communicate to readers that part of the input is ignored." For more detail's:
****** Informative:
"The question mark is part of the name, and is not related to the use of question marks to indicate nullable types in C# or Kotlin. In the definition of List.head?, an underscore is used to represent the tail of the list. In patterns, underscores match anything at all, but do not introduce variables to refer to the matched data. Using underscores instead of names is a way to clearly communicate to readers that part of the input is ignored."

***** Prod
It's basically the "Pair", because we're inside the type cat.
#+begin_src lean4
structure Prod (α : Type) (β : Type) : Type where
  fst : α
  snd : β
#+end_src

About confort syntax:
#+begin_src lean4
-- Better
def fives : String × Int := { fst := "five", snd := 5 }
-- A way better:
def fives : String × Int := ("five", 5)
#+end_src

****** About syntax associativity:
"Both notations are right-associative. This means that the following definitions are equivalent:"

#+begin_src lean4
-- The
def sevens : String × Int × Nat := ("VII", 7, 4 + 3)
-- Is acctualy
def sevens : String × (Int × Nat) := ("VII", (7, 4 + 3))
#+end_src

"In other words, all products of more than two types, and their corresponding constructors, are actually nested products and nested pairs behind the scenes."
****** A good advice:
"Many applications are best served by defining their own structures, even for simple cases like Point, because using domain terminology can make it easier to read the code. Additionally, defining structure types helps catch more errors by assigning different types to different domain concepts, preventing them from being mixed up."

***** Sum
"Values of type Sum α β are either the constructor inl applied to a value of type α or the constructor inr applied to a value of type β:"
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Sum (α : Type) (β : Type) : Type where
  | inl : α → Sum α β
  | inr : β → Sum α β
#+end_src

Another notation (wrost than the simplier "+")
#+begin_src lean4
def PetName : Type := String ⊕ String
#+end_src

Example:
#+begin_src lean4
def howManyDogs (pets : List PetName) : Nat :=
  match pets with
  | []                    => 0
  | Sum.inl _ :: morePets => howManyDogs morePets + 1
  | Sum.inr _ :: morePets => howManyDogs morePets
#+end_src

***** Unit
Just like it should be:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Unit : Type where
  | unit : Unit
#+end_src

To the unique member of the "Unit" type, u can also call it by
the classical "()".

***** Empty
This should be fine:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Empty where

#check Empty
#+end_src

"The Empty datatype has no constructors whatsoever. Thus, it indicates unreachable code, because no series of calls can ever terminate with a value at type Empty.

Empty is not used nearly as often as Unit. However, it is useful in some specialized contexts. Many polymorphic datatypes do not use all of their type arguments in all of their constructors. For instance, Sum.inl and Sum.inr each use only one of Sum's type arguments. Using Empty as one of the type arguments to Sum can rule out one of the constructors at a particular point in a program. This can allow generic code to be used in contexts that have additional restrictions."
*** Additional Conveniences
**** Automatic Implicit Arguments
"When writing polymorphic functions in Lean, it is typically not necessary to list all the implicit arguments."

So, that definition:
#+begin_src lean4
def length {α : Type} (xs : List α) : Nat :=
  match xs with
  | []      => 0
  | y :: ys => Nat.succ (length ys)
#+end_src

Can be written this way:
#+begin_src lean4
def length (xs : List α) : Nat :=
  match xs with
  | []      => 0
  | y :: ys => Nat.succ (length ys)
#+end_src

**** Pattern-Matching Definitions
"When defining functions with def, it is quite common to name an argument and then immediately
use it with pattern matching. For instance, in length, the argument xs is used only in match.
In these situations, the cases of the match expression can be written directly, without naming the argument at all."

Example:
#+begin_src lean4
def length : List α → Nat
  | []      => 0
  | y :: ys => Nat.succ (length ys)
#+end_src

"This syntax can also be used to define functions that take more than one argument. In this case,
their patterns are separated by commas."

Example:
#+begin_src lean4
def drop : Nat → List α → List α
  | Nat.zero  , xs      => xs
  | _         , []      => []
  | Nat.succ n, x :: xs => drop n xs
#+end_src

"Named arguments and patterns can also be used in the same definition."
#+begin_src lean4
def fromOption (default : α) : Option α → α
  | none   => default
  | some x => x
#+end_src

"This function is called Option.getD in the standard library,
  and can be called with dot notation", btw.

#+begin_src lean4
#eval (some "salmonberry").getD "" --> "salmonberry"
#eval none.getD ""                 --> ""
#+end_src

**** Local Definitions
"In Lean, the result of the recursive call can be named, and thus saved, using let. Local definitions with let resemble top-level definitions with def: it takes a name to be locally defined, arguments if desired, a type signature, and then a body following :=. After the local definition, the expression in which the local definition is available (called the body of the let-expression) must be on a new line, starting at a column in the file that is less than or equal to that of the let keyword. For instance, let can be used in unzip like this:"
#+begin_src lean4
def unzip : List (α × β) → List α × List β
  | []            => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: xys =>
    let unzipped : List α × List β := unzip xys
    (x :: unzipped.fst, y :: unzipped.snd)
#+end_src

"To use let on a single line, separate the local definition from the body with a semicolon."

"Local definitions with let may also use pattern matching when one pattern is enough to match all cases of a datatype. In the case of unzip, the result of the recursive call is a pair. Because pairs have only a single constructor, the name unzipped can be replaced with a pair pattern:"
#+begin_src lean4
def unzip : List (α × β) → List α × List β
  | [] => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: xys =>
    let (xs, ys) : List α × List β := unzip xys
    (x :: xs, y :: ys)
#+end_src

NEW FEATURE:
"The biggest difference between let and def is that recursive let definitions must be explicitly indicated by writing let rec. For instance, one way to reverse a list involves a recursive helper function, as in this definition:"
#+begin_src lean4
def reverse (xs : List α) : List α :=
  let rec helper : List α → List α → List α
    | [], soFar => soFar
    | y :: ys, soFar => helper ys (y :: soFar)
  helper xs []
#+end_src

**** Type Inference
"In many situations, Lean can automatically determine an expression's type. In these cases, explicit types may be omitted from both top-level definitions (with def) and local definitions (with let). For instance, the recursive call to unzip does not need an annotation:"
#+begin_src lean4
def unzip : List (α × β) → List α × List β
  | []            => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: xys =>
    let unzipped := unzip xys
    (x :: unzipped.fst, y :: unzipped.snd)
#+end_src

In deed, it could even be like this:
#+begin_src lean4
def unnzip : List (α × β) → List α × List β
  | []            => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: xys =>
    let (xs, ys) := unzip xys
    (x :: xs, y :: ys)
#+end_src

"Omitting the return type for unzip is possible when using an explicit match expression:"
#+begin_src lean4
def unzip (pairs : List (α × β)) :=
  match pairs with
  | [] => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: xys =>
    let unzipped := unzip xys
    (x :: unzipped.fst, y :: unzipped.snd)
#+end_src

"Missing type annotations can give confusing error messages. Omitting all types from the definition of unzip:"
#+begin_src lean4
def unzip pairs :=
  match pairs with
  | [] => ([], [])
  | (x, y) :: xys =>
    let unzipped := unzip xys
    (x :: unzipped.fst, y :: unzipped.snd)
#+end_src

It generate this error message:
#+begin_src error
invalid match-expression, pattern contains metavariables
  []
#+end_src

"This is because match needs to know the type of the value being inspected, but that type was not available."

"Even some very simple programs require type annotations. For instance, the identity function just returns whatever argument it is passed. With argument and type annotations, it looks like this:"
#+begin_src lean4
def id (x : α) : α := x
#+end_src

"Lean is capable of determining the return type on its own:"
#+begin_src lean4
def id (x : α) := x
#+end_src

"Omitting the argument type, however, causes an error:"
#+begin_src lean4
def id x := x --> (!) failed to infer binder type
#+end_src

**** Simultaneous Matching
"Pattern-matching expressions, just like pattern-matching definitions, can match on multiple values at once. "

Look at this:
#+begin_src lean4
def drop (n : Nat) (xs : List α) : List α :=
  match n, xs with
  | Nat.zero   , ys      => ys
  | _          , []      => []
  | Nat.succ n , y :: ys => drop n ys
#+end_src

**** Natural Number Patterns
"Just as there is special syntax to make list patterns more readable
than using List.cons and List.nil directly, natural numbers can be
matched using literal numbers and +. For instance, even can also be
defined like this:"
#+begin_src lean4
def even : Nat → Bool
  | 0     => true
  | n + 1 => not (even n)
#+end_src

The explicit patterns in halve, which divides a Nat by two and drops the remainder:
#+begin_src lean4
def halve : Nat → Nat
  | Nat.zero => 0
  | Nat.succ Nat.zero => 0
  | Nat.succ (Nat.succ n) => halve n + 1
#+end_src

can be replaced by numeric literals and +:
#+begin_src lean4
def halve : Nat → Nat
  | 0     => 0
  | 1     => 0
  | n + 2 => halve n + 1
#+end_src

"When using this syntax, the second argument to + should always be a literal Nat. Even though addition is commutative."

**** Anonymous Functions
The both can be used:
#+begin_src lean4
#check fun
  | 0 => none
  | n + 1 => some n
#check λ
  | 0 => none
  | n + 1 => some n
#+end_src

So, basicaly: fun = λ.
It's a bit more usual to use "fun" instead of "λ", btw.

Awelsome syntax gift:
"When an anonymous function is very simple, like fun x => x + 1, the syntax for creating the function can be fairly verbose. In that particular example, six non-whitespace characters are used to introduce the function, and its body consists of only three non-whitespace characters. For these simple cases, Lean provides a shorthand. In an expression surrounded by parentheses, a centered dot character · can stand for an argument, and the expression inside the parentheses becomes the function's body. That particular function can also be written (· + 1)."

"The centered dot always creates a function out of the closest surrounding set of parentheses. For instance, (· + 5, 3) is a function that returns a pair of numbers, while ((· + 5), 3) is a pair of a function and a number. If multiple dots are used, then they become arguments from left to right:"

#+begin_src lean4
(· , ·) 1 2
===>
(1, ·) 2
===>
(1, 2)
#+end_src

**** Namespaces
Each name in Lean occurs in a namespace, which is a collection of names. Names are placed in namespaces using ., so List.map is the name map in the List namespace.

Names can be directly defined within a namespace. For instance, the name double can be defined in the Nat namespace:
#+begin_src lean4
def Nat.double (x : Nat) : Nat := x + x
#+end_src

Because Nat is also the name of a type, dot notation is available to call Nat.double on expressions with type Nat:
#+begin_src lean4
#eval (4 : Nat).double
#+end_src

In addition to defining names directly in a namespace, a sequence of declarations can be placed in a namespace using the namespace and end commands. For instance, this defines triple and quadruple in the namespace NewNamespace:
#+begin_src lean4
namespace NewNamespace
def triple    (x : Nat) : Nat := 3 * x
def quadruple (x : Nat) : Nat := 2 * x + 2 * x
end NewNamespace
#+end_src

"Namespaces may be opened, which allows the names in them to be used without explicit qualification. Writing open MyNamespace in before an expression causes the contents of MyNamespace to be available in the expression. For example, timesTwelve uses both quadruple and triple after opening NewNamespace:"
#+begin_src lean4
def timesTwelve (x : Nat) :=
  open NewNamespace in
  quadruple (triple x)
#+end_src

Namespaces can also be opened prior to a command. This allows all parts of the command to refer to the contents of the namespace, rather than just a single expression. To do this, place the open ... in prior to the command.
#+begin_src lean4
open NewNamespace in
#check quadruple
#+end_src

Important:
"Function signatures show the name's full namespace. Namespaces may additionally be opened for all following commands for the rest of the file. To do this, simply omit the in from a top-level usage of open."

**** if let
a function that recognizes string elements and extracts their contents can be written:
#+begin_src lean4
def Inline.string? (inline : Inline) : Option String :=
  match inline with
  | Inline.string s => some s
  | _               => none
#+end_src

An alternative way of writing this function's body uses if together with let:
#+begin_src lean4
def Inline.string? (inline : Inline) : Option String :=
  if let Inline.string s := inline then
    some s
  else none
#+end_src

It really look like some `instanceOf`'s.. Ugly, yeah!

**** Positional Structure Arguments
With some context, like definitions, because
Structures are essencialy tupples, we can write
it like this:
#+begin_src lean4
#eval (⟨1, 2⟩ : Point)
#+end_src
**** String Interpolation
"In Lean, prefixing a string with s! triggers interpolation, where expressions contained in curly braces inside the string are replaced with their values. This is similar to f-strings in Python and $-prefixed strings in C#. For instance,"
#+begin_src lean4
#eval s!"three fives is {NewNamespace.triple 5}"
 --> "three fives is 15"
#+end_src

*** TODO "Summary"
** Hello, World!
*** Compiling
So u use `lean --rn file-name.lean` in order
to compile things.

*** The main
The main should look similar to in Haskell as bellow:
#+begin_src lean4
def main : IO Unit := IO.println "Hello, world!"
#+end_src

*** The IO
In a first look, the usage looks pretty similar to Haskells.
#+begin_src lean4
def main : IO Unit := do
  let stdin  ← IO.getStdin
  let stdout ← IO.getStdout

  stdout.putStrLn "How would you like to be addressed?"
  let input ← stdin.getLine
  let name := input.dropRightWhile Char.isWhitespace

  stdout.putStrLn s!"Hello, {name}!"
#+end_src

*** Build Tool's (Lake)
**** Lake intro
The standard Lean build tool is called Lake (short for "Lean Make").

"Just as Lean contains a special-purpose language for writing programs with effects (the do language), Lake contains a special-purpose language for configuring builds."

**** Creating a project
Lake new create a new project in a new directory, to create a project in an already-existing directory,
run lake init instead.

**** Special "<< name >>"
Placing guillemets around a name, as in «Greeting», allow it to contain spaces or other characters that are normally not allowed in Lean names, and it allows reserved keywords such as if or def to be used as ordinary names by writing «if» or «def». This prevents issues when the package name provided to lake new contains such characters.

**** Running the project
To build the package, run the command lake build. After a number of build commands scroll by, the
resulting binary has been placed in build/bin. Running `./build/bin/greeting` results in Hello, world!.

To me it appeared in a file inside `.lake/build/bin/`

**** Lake documentation link
https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/lake/README.md

**** Lean4 as the Lider
"Additionally, Lakefiles may contain external libraries, which are libraries not written in Lean to be
statically linked with the resulting executable."

**** Module vs Namespaces
"Import is used to make the contents of a source file available, while open makes names from a namespace available in the current context without prefixes."

**** Selective Openning
Similar to Haskell, (but with the segragation of module vs namespace), you can write
`open Nat (toFloat)` to get only open `toFloat` to usage.

**** Main Types
 In Lean, main can have one of three types:

- main : IO Unit corresponds to programs that cannot read their command-line arguments and always indicate success with an exit code of 0

- main : IO UInt32 corresponds to int main(void) in C, for programs without arguments that return exit codes, and

- main : List String → IO UInt32 corresponds to int main(int argc, char **argv) in C, for programs that take arguments and signal success or failure.
*** TODO Conveniences
*** TODO Summary
** Overloading and Type Classes
*** Intro
**** Intro
A type class consists of a name, some parameters, and a collection of methods.

declaring a type class really results in the following:

A structure type to contain the implementation of each overloaded operation
A namespace with the same name as the class
For each method, a function in the class's namespace that retrieves its implementation from an instance

**** Parameters
Describe the types for which overloadable operations are being defined
**** Methods
Are the names and type signatures of the overloadable operations.
**** Short Example
#+begin_src lean4
class Plus (α : Type) where
  plus : α → α → α

instance : Plus Nat where
  plus := Nat.add
#+end_src
**** HAdd and HMul
HAdd is short for heterogeneous addition.
For example, an HAdd instance can be written to allow a Nat to be added to a Float, resulting in a new Float. When a programmer writes x + y, it is interpreted as meaning HAdd.hAdd x y.

#+begin_src lean4
def addNatPos : Nat → Pos → Pos
  | 0    , p => p
  | n + 1, p => Pos.succ (addNatPos n p)

def addPosNat : Pos → Nat → Pos
  | p, 0     => p
  | p, n + 1 => Pos.succ (addPosNat p n)
#+end_src

this type of of overloading is a lot more powerful than the "Add" and "Mul", because here we can add things with 2 diferent types. From this example, let's see it working:

#+begin_src lean4
instance : HAdd Nat Pos Pos where
  hAdd := addNatPos

instance : HAdd Pos Nat Pos where
  hAdd := addPosNat

#eval (3 : Pos) + (5 : Nat) --> 8
#eval (3 : Nat) + (5 : Pos) --> 8
#+end_src


**** Very very useful thing i've made
Since the Lean libraries are set up so that an instance of Add will be found when searching for an instance of HAdd in which both arguments have the same type, i did:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : Add Type where
  add := Sum
-- and now it's possible to write:
#check Int + String --> Type
#+end_src

Just as "HAdd", there's a "HMul" and also there's a simplier "Mul"
for the case when the two arguments have the same type.

**** Literals ("OfNat" class)
In Lean, natural number literals are interpreted using a type class called OfNat:
#+begin_src lean4
class OfNat (α : Type) (_ : Nat) where
  ofNat : α
#+end_src

**** Very weird thing!
#+begin_src lean4
class Foo (n : Nat) where
  const : Nat
open Foo

instance : Foo 5 where
  const := 42

instance : Foo 4 where
  const := 53

#eval const 5 --> 42
#eval const 4 --> 53
#eval const 3 --> !ERROR "failed to synthetize"
#end_src
**** TODO A Short Example (HTTP)
*** Polymorphism
**** About constraints
Here the "IO.println" need to receive a type that insatnciate the "ToString" class.

#+begin_src lean4
#check IO.println   --> IO.prinln.{u_1} {α : Type u_1} [ToString α] (s : α) : IO Unit
#check (IO.println) --> IO.println : ?m.10872 → IO Unit
#check @IO.println  --> @IO.println : {α : Type u_1} → [inst : ToString α] → α → IO Unit
#+end_src

In Lean4, they call constraints as "Instance Implicits"
**** Defining Polymorphic Functions with Instance Implicits
There is an example:
#+begin_src lean4
def List.sum [Add α] [OfNat α 0] : List α → α
 | []      => 0
 | x :: xs => x + xs.sum

instance [Add α] : Add (PPoint α) where
  add p1 p2 := { x := p1.x + p2.x, y := p1.y + p2.y }
#+end_src

**** TODO Even Number Literals
Write an instance of OfNat for the even number datatype from the previous section's (4.1) exercises that uses recursive instance search.
For the base instance, it is necessary to write OfNat Even Nat.zero instead of OfNat Even 0.
*** WAIT Instance Search
**** Intro
In the past we've be seen the HAdd type class.

The definition of the HAdd type class is very much like the following definition of HPlus
#+begin_src lean4
class HPlus (α : Type) (β : Type) (γ : Type) where
  hPlus : α → β → γ

-- but:
#eval HPlus.hPlus (3 : Pos) (5 : Nat)         --> !Error
#eval (HPlus.hPlus (3 : Pos) (5 : Nat) : Pos) --> 8
#+end_src

**** Default Instances
"Default instances are instances that are available for instance search even when not all their inputs are known."

One example of where default instances can be useful is an instance of HPlus that can be derived from an Add instance. In other words, ordinary addition is a special case of heterogeneous addition in which all three types happen to be the same. This can be implemented using the following instance:
#+begin_src lean4
instance [Add α] : HPlus α α α where
  hPlus := Add.add

-- But:
#check HPlus.hPlus (5 : Nat) --> HPlus.hPlus 5 : ?m.7706 → ?m.7708
#+end_src

In the vast majority of cases, when someone supplies one argument to addition, the other argument will have the same type. To make this instance into a default instance, apply the default_instance attribute:
#+begin_src lean4
@[default_instance]
instance [Add α] : HPlus α α α where
  hPlus := Add.add

-- And now:
#check HPlus.hPlus (5 : Nat) --> HPlus.hPlus 5 : Nat → Nat
#+end_src

For more details, consult the Lean4 manual!

*** Arrays
**** Intro
For instance, Lean arrays are much more efficient than linked lists for most purposes. In Lean, the type Array α is a dynamically-sized array holding values of type α, much like a Java ArrayList, a C++ std::vector

**** FunFact about compiler
In pure functional languages like Lean, it is not possible to mutate a given position in a data structure. Instead, a copy is made that has the desired modifications. When using an array, the Lean compiler and runtime contain an optimization that can allow modifications to be implemented as mutations behind the scenes when there is only a single unique reference to an array.

**** Example
Arrays are written similarly to lists, but with a leading #:
#+begin_src lean4
def northernTrees : Array String :=
  #["sloe", "birch", "elm", "oak"]

#eval northernTrees.size --> 4
#+end_src

*** Non-Empty Lists
Default implementation:
#+begin_src lean4
structure NonEmptyList (α : Type) : Type where
  head : α
  tail : List α
#+end_src

Example of functions beein declared about this type:
#+begin_src lean4
def NonEmptyList.get? : NonEmptyList α → Nat → Option α
  | xs, 0 => some xs.head
  | {head := _, tail := []}, _ + 1 => none
  | {head := _, tail := h :: t}, n + 1 => get? {head := h, tail := t} n

-- Another idea:
def NonEmptyList.get? : NonEmptyList α → Nat → Option α
  | xs, 0 => some xs.head
  | xs, n + 1 => xs.tail.get? n
#+end_src

*** Overloading Indexing
**** Intro
Indexing notation for a collection type can be overloaded by defining an instance of the GetElem type class.
Here are the paramters:
- The type of the collection,
- The type of the index,
- The type of elements that are extracted from the collection,
- A function that determines what counts as evidence that the index is in bounds;

Here's the implementation:
#+begin_src lean4
class GetElem (coll : Type) (idx : Type) (item : outParam Type) (inBounds : outParam (coll → idx → Prop)) where
  getElem : (c : coll) → (i : idx) → inBounds c i → item
#+end_src

Here's some instancement's
#+begin_src lean4
instance : GetElem (NonEmptyList α) Nat α NonEmptyList.inBounds where
  getElem :=
    fun : (xs : NonEmptyList α) (i : Nat) (ok : xs.inBounds i) : α :=
      match i with
      | 0     => xs.head
      | n + 1 => xs.tail[n]

instance : GetElem (PPoint α) Bool α (fun _ _ => True) where
getElem (p : PPoint α) (i : Bool) _ :=
  if not i then p.x else p.y
#+end_src

*** Standard Classes
**** Intro
Firstly i want to say that this text is just so good that i'll just C-w and C-y it here :).

This section presents a variety of operators and functions that can be overloaded using type classes in Lean. Each operator or function corresponds to a method of a type class. Unlike C++, infix operators in Lean are defined as abbreviations for named functions; this means that overloading them for new types is not done using the operator itself, but rather using the underlying name (such as HAdd.hAdd).

**** Arithmetic
Most arithmetic operators are available in a heterogeneous form, where the arguments may have different type and an output parameter decides the type of the resulting expression. For each heterogeneous operator, there is a corresponding homogeneous version that can found by removing the letter h, so that HAdd.hAdd becomes Add.add. The following arithmetic operators are overloaded:

[[file:./contents/images/Screenshot From 2025-03-12 19-28-45.png]]

**** Bitwise Operators
Lean contains a number of standard bitwise operators that are overloaded using type classes. There are instances for fixed-width types such as UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, and USize. The latter is the size of words on the current platform, typically 32 or 64 bits. The following bitwise operators are overloaded:

[[file:./contents/images/Screenshot From 2025-03-12 19-34-44.png]]

Because the names And and Or are already taken as the names of logical connectives, the homogeneous versions of HAnd and HOr are called AndOp and OrOp rather than And and Or.

**** Equality and Ordering
It's just simple:
#+begin_src lean4
#check (· = ·)  --> fun x1 x2 => x1 = x2  : ?m.4509 → ?m.4509 → Prop
#check (· == ·) --> fun x1 x2 => x1 == x2 : ?m.4523 → ?m.4523 → Bool
#+end_src

Some values, such as functions, cannot be checked for equality, btw.
Also, some propositions are decidable, what makes possible to use then into
a if statement, like that:
#+begin_src lean4
#check 2 < 3                 --> 2 < 3 : Prop
#eval if 2 < 3 then 1 else 2 --> 1
#+end_src

The following propositions, that are usually decidable, are overloaded with type classes:

[[file:./contents/images/Screenshot From 2025-03-13 09-59-33.png]]

About ordering, just like in Coq, Lean4 has a "Ordering":
#+begin_src lean4
inductive Ordering where
| lt
| eq
| gt
#+end_src

A good example that i've made by myself:
#+begin_src lean4
def Nat.comp : Nat → Nat → Ordering
  | 0, 0         => Ordering.eq
  | _, 0         => Ordering.gt
  | 0, _         => Ordering.lt
  | n + 1, m + 1 => Nat.comp n m
#+end_src

**** Hashing
Here's the Lean4 implemented especification:
#+begin_src lean4
class Hashable (α : Type) where
  hash : α → UInt64
#+end_src

I think that some laws could be added
#+begin_src lean4
class MyHashable (α : Type) where
  hash : α → UInt64
  eqPreserv : ∀(a₁ a₂ : α), a₁ = a₂ →
                hash a₁ = hash a₂
#+end_src
Or even maybe a boolanized version of this.

"The standard library contains a function mixHash with type UInt64 → UInt64 → UInt64 that can be used to combine hashes for different fields for a constructor."

With this, we can write:
#+begin_src lean4
def hashNat : Nat → UInt64
  | 0     => 0
  | n + 1 => mixHash 1 (hashNat n)

instance : Hashable Nat where
  hash := hashNat
#+end_src

**** Constraints
Just look at this:
#+begin_src lean4
inductive BinTree (α : Type) where
  | leaf : BinTree α
  | branch : BinTree α → α → BinTree α → BinTree α

def eqBinTree [BEq α] : BinTree α → BinTree α → Bool
  | BinTree.leaf, BinTree.leaf =>
    true
  | BinTree.branch l x r, BinTree.branch l2 x2 r2 =>
    x == x2 && eqBinTree l l2 && eqBinTree r r2
  | _, _ =>
    false

instance [BEq α] : BEq (BinTree α) where
  beq := eqBinTree

def hashBinTree [Hashable α] : BinTree α → UInt64
  | BinTree.leaf =>
    0
  | BinTree.branch left x right =>
    mixHash 1 (mixHash (hashBinTree left) (mixHash (hash x) (hashBinTree right)))

instance [Hashable α] : Hashable (BinTree α) where
  hash := hashBinTree
#+end_src

**** Deriving
"Instances can be derived in two ways. The first can be used when defining a structure or inductive type. In this case, add deriving to the end of the type declaration followed by the names of the classes for which instances should be derived. For a type that is already defined, a standalone deriving command can be used. Write deriving instance C1, C2, ... for T to derive instances of C1, C2, ... for the type T after the fact."

Example:
#+begin_src lean4
deriving instance BEq, Hashable for Pos
deriving instance BEq, Hashable, Repr for NonEmptyList
#+end_src

Instances can be derived for at least the following classes:
- Inhabited
- BEq
- Repr
- Hashable
- Ord

  (There's no code generator was found for ToString, btw..)

**** Appending
"Instances can be derived in two ways. The first can be used when defining a structure or inductive type. In this case, add deriving to the end of the type declaration followed by the names of the classes for which instances should be derived. For a type that is already defined, a standalone deriving command can be used. Write deriving instance C1, C2, ... for T to derive instances of C1, C2, ... for the type T after the fact."

Example:
#+begin_src lean4
deriving instance BEq, Hashable for Pos
deriving instance BEq, Hashable, Repr for NonEmptyList
#+end_src

Instances can be derived for at least the following classes:
- Inhabited
- BEq
- Repr
- Hashable
- Ord

There's the type class:
#+begin_src lean4
class HAppend (α : Type) (β : Type) (γ : outParam Type) where
  hAppend : α → β → γ
#+end_src

There's a heterogeneous implementation above it:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : HAppend (NonEmptyList α) (List α) (NonEmptyList α) where
  hAppend xs ys :=
    { head := xs.head, tail := xs.tail ++ ys }
#+end_src


**** Functors
Like Haskell, we have the "<$>" operator, so u can do:
#+begin_src lean4
#eval (· + 5) <$> [1, 2, 3] --> [6, 7, 8]
#+end_src

A instance for PPoint:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : Functor PPoint where
  map f p := { x := f p.x, y := f p.y }
#+end_src

Just a default implementation used in a primite way to think in Functors:
#+begin_src lean4
class Functor (f : Type → Type) where
  map : {α β : Type} → (α → β) → f α → f β

  mapConst {α β : Type} (x : α) (coll : f β) : f α :=
    map (fun _ => x) coll
#+end_src

A maturier idea:
#+begin_src lean4
class Funktor (F : Type → Type) where
  -- Operations:
  map : {α β : Type} → (α → β) → F α → F β

  mapConst {α β : Type} (x : α) (coll : F β) : F α :=
    map (fun _ => x) coll

 -- Laws:
  id_law   : ∀(f_a : F α), map id f_a = fa
  comp_law : ∀(f : α → β), ∀(g : β → γ), ∀(f_a : F α),
               map (g ∘ f) f_a = map g (map f f_a)

  -- Being associative was a theorem then?
#+end_src

Some implementation:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : Funktor BinTree where
  map := binTreeMap
#+end_src

*** TODO Coercions
**** Intro
"In Lean, both purposes are served by a mechanism called coercions. When Lean encounters an expression of one type in a context that expects a different type, it will attempt to coerce the expression before reporting a type error. Unlike Java, C, and Kotlin, the coercions are extensible by defining instances of type classes."

**** The Coe typeclass
The type class Coe describes overloaded ways of coercing from one type to another:
#+begin_src lean4
class coe (α : type) (β : type) where
  coe : α → β
#+end_src

An instance of Coe Pos Nat is enough to allow the prior code to work:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : Coe Pos Nat where
  coe x := x.toNat

#eval  [1, 2, 3, 4].drop (2 : Pos) --> [3, 4]
#check [1, 2, 3, 4].drop (2 : Pos) --> List.drop (Pos.toNat 2) [1, 2, 3, 4] : List Nat
#+end_src

**** Coe Chains
When searching for coercions, Lean will attempt to assemble a coercion out of a chain of smaller coercions. For example, there is already a coercion from Nat to Int. Because of that instance, combined with the Coe Pos Nat instance, the following code is accepted:
#+begin_src lean4
def oneInt : Int := Pos.one
#+end_src

This definition uses two coercions: from Pos to Nat, and then from Nat to Int.

Btw, they don't get circular and also it has a standart coercion about "Option" so all of this compiles:
#+begin_src lean4
#check ("oi" : Option String)
#check Option Type
def perhapsPerhapsPerhaps : Option (Option (Option String)) :=
  "Please don't tell me"
def perhapsPerhapsPerhapsNat : Option (Option (Option Nat)) :=
  ↑(392 : Nat)
#+end_src

That arrow, btw, is used to ensure that Lean finds the right
instances. It can also make the programmer's intentions more clear.

**** Dependent Coercions (The CoeDep typeclass)
There's the class:
#+begin_src lean4
class CoeDep (α : Type) (x : α) (β : Type) where
  coe : β
#+end_src

There's a use:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : CoeDep (List α) (x :: xs) (NonEmptyList α) where
  coe := { head := x, tail := xs }
#+end_src

***** Some more explanation
"Dependent coercions can be used when the ability to coerce from one type to another depends on which particular value is being coerced. Just as the OfNat type class takes the particular Nat being overloaded as a parameter, dependent coercion takes the value being coerced as a parameter"

"This is a chance to select only certain values, either by imposing further type class constraints on the value or by writing certain constructors directly."

**** TODO Coercing to Types (The CoeSort typeclass)
 Just as Coe is checked when a type mismatch occurs, CoeSort is used when something other than a sort is provided in a context where a sort would be expected.

 Some examples of sort (Type or Prop)
 #+begin_src lean4
instance : CoeSort Monoid Type where
  coe m := m.Carrier
 #+end_src

Another example:
#+begin_src lean4
instance : CoeSort Bool Prop where
  coe b := b = true

#check (if · then · else ·) --> !Error [...] &
       -- (fun x1 x2 x3 => ?m.9836 : Prop → ?m.9869 → ?m.9869 → ?m.9869)
#+end_src

Rather than have two kinds of if expression, the Lean standard library defines a coercion from Bool to
the proposition that the Bool in question is equal to true.

**** TODO Coercing to Funcions
That's is weird..
Here's the implementation:
#+begin_src lean4
class CoeFun (α : Type) (makeFunctionType : outParam (α → Type)) where
  coe : (x : α) → makeFunctionType x
#+end_src

And here's the weird example:
#+begin_src lean4
structure Adder where
  howMuch : Nat

def add5 : Adder := ⟨5⟩
instance : CoeFun Adder (fun _ => Nat → Nat) where
  coe a := (· + a.howMuch)

#eval add5 3 --> 8
#+end_src
